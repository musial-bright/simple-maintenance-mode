Description:
  Install simple maintenance mode for your applications.
  The installation will copy migrations and pages into your migrations/public
  rails app folder.

  What you have to do:
    - Put the check_maintenance_mode filter in your application_controller.rb
    - Integrate a maintenance mode checkbox in your rails app application for
      convenience.

  Final notes:
    You will be able to access the website with the get parameter 
    maintenance_mode_override=1 even if the maintenance mode is active. This is
    an option for administrators, who want to test the side before turning off
    the maintenance mode.

Example:
  rails generate simple_maintenance_mode:install

  This will create following files in your rails app:
    - db/migrations/..._create_app_config.rb
    - public/maintenance.html
